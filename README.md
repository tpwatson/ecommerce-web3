This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.



## Idea & Goals With Repo
 - To create a simplified ecommerce website with potentially some web3 capabilities, in 3 days or less.
 - To have it fully deployed online with SQL database (using Amazon RDS) for practice
 - To not use vibe coding, some auto-completion for speed though if I've already decided how the code should be.
 - To have the potential to actually earn via USDC, SOL, or Stripe payments.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!
