## Idea & Goals With Repo
 - To create a simplified ecommerce website with potentially some web3 capabilities, in 3 days or less.
 - To have it fully deployed online with SQL database (using Amazon RDS) for practice
 - To not use vibe coding, some auto-completion for speed though if I've already decided how the code should be.
 - To have the potential to actually earn via USDC, SOL, or Stripe payments.
